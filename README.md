# Food Picker
An App that helps you decide what to order in! Select options for the app to choose from, it picks randomly from your selections. 

Built in React.js with Sass.

Each card component is generated by mapping through a list of cuisines. Selecting adds the selected food with the boolean true to the state as an object. The user is able to add new cards to pick from. 

Mobile responsive.
